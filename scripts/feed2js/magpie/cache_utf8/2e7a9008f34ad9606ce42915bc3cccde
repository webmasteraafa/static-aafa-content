                It’s common to see the term “hypoallergenic” on many products and services. It’s a word many consumers have become comfortable with. It makes some believe anything with this label is better for them and less likely to trigger asthma and allergy symptoms. But you may be surprised to find there is no regulation on how a product can be labeled “hypoallergenic.”</p>

                Six years ago, Lisa Kelly went to see her doctor about a chronic cough. She learned she has severe uncontrolled asthma. With her doctor’s help, she has since tried various treatments to manage her asthma. They have each helped for a little while, but not as much as she would like. In 2017, she discovered the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America's (AAFA) online community.</p>

                Biologics are targeted therapies made from living organisms or natural sources. Biologic therapy involves injections every few weeks or so that are tailored to the individual. Biologics help normalize your immune system by controlling immune responses that lead to inflammation. There are biologic treatments available for people with moderate-to-severe asthma or atopic dermatitis (eczema).</p>

                Dry and/or cold air is a trigger for airway narrowing (bronchoconstriction) and can be a weather-related asthma trigger. When you breathe in cold, dry air through your mouth, the air doesn't get warmed by your nose first. The cold air goes to your lungs and airways. This can trigger an asthma attack. Try these tips to avoid having cold air trigger your asthma.</p>

                Today the acting administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Andrew Wheeler, announced a proposal to dramatically weaken the Carbon Pollution Standards for New, Modified and Reconstructed Power Plants, which are protections against carbon pollution that have been in effect since 2015. Fifteen groups sent this letter in response.</p>

                When Diana Hanley’s daughter Jamie was a baby, she wheezed every time she got sick. She had her first allergic reaction to eggs at 11 months. Around age 2, she was diagnosed with a peanut allergy. And because of constant hives, many foods were removed from her diet. Her family is now part of research to help families managing asthma and allergies. Read Jamie's story.</p>

                If you’ve suffered with severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) for a long time and have tried what you think is every available option for relief, you may want to consider allergy shots. A medically-challenging case being presented at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) Annual Scientific Meeting found that allergy shots provided significant benefits to the eczema symptoms suffered by a 48-year-old man.</p>
